## 📋 Guidelines for Daily Updates

### Daily Folder Structure
Each day should follow this consistent structure:
```
dayXX/
├── README.md       # Daily summary and overview
├── tasks.md        # Task tracking
├── learnings.md    # Key learnings and insights
├── notes.md        # Additional notes
└── resources/      # Supporting files and materials
    └── README.md
```

### Daily README Format
- **Date**: Always include the current date
- **Status**: Update status (⬜️ Not Started, 🔄 In Progress, ✅ Completed)
- **Focus**: Define clear daily focus
- **Tasks**: Check off completed tasks
- **Achievements**: Document wins
